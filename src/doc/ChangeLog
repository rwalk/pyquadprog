	* Release 1.4 ready.

	* First.lib.template:
	Corrected copyright notice.  Changed to Release 1.4.

	* solve.QP.d, solve.QP.compact.d:
	Corrected copyright notice.  Changed occurrence of .AT to .AG (pointed
	out by Brian Ripley).

	* solve.QP.compact.sf, solve.QP.sf: Corrected copyright notice.

	* solve.QP.f, solve.QP.compact.f, aind.f, achck.f:
	Corrected copyright notice, rearranged declaration of variable (it
	seems f2c and the windows compiler do not like the old sequence;
	pointed out by Andreas Weingessel and Brian Ripley, respectively)

Mon Jul  6 06:25:56 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* Release 1.3 ready.

	* First.lib.template:
	Changed to GNU Library Public License, changed start up message and
	changed to Release 1.3.

	* solve.QP.compact.sf, solve.QP.sf:
	Changed to GNU Library Public License and added code to check at the
	end whether constraints are really satisfied.

	* achck.f: Initial revision

	* solve.QP.f, solve.QP.compact.f:
	Changed to GNU Library Public License and corrected a typo in the
	documentation pointed out by Peter Chen <PChen@POSTOFFICE.nacm.com>

	* solve.QP.compact.d, solve.QP.d:
	Added GNU Library Public License notice

	* aind.f: Changed to GNU Library Public License

	* Release 1.2 ready.

	* First.lib.template:
	Changed to Release 1.2 after recent bug fix in Fortran code and
	changes to S-plus interface and help files.

	* solve.QP.compact.sf:
	Added a Fortran routine that checks whether all elements of Aind which
	are accessed are valid.  Prior (S-plus coded) test was too crude and
	failed if constraints had different lengths and shorter constraints
	were filled up with zeros.

	* aind.f: Initial revision

Sun Dec 28 07:49:18 1997  Berwin Turlach  <berwin.turlach@anu.edu.au>

	* solve.QP.sf, solve.QP.compact.sf:
	Deleted `miter' from parameter list as underlying Fortran code doesn't
	have it anymore.  Deleted all storage.mode commands and defined mode
	in call to Fortran routine (my preferred style these days).  Added
	checks whether dimensions of arguments are compatible and sensible.

	* solve.QP.d, solve.QP.compact.d:
	Reworded the help file and brought it closer to the style described in
	the complements of V&R 2nd ed.

	* solve.QP.f, solve.QP.compact.f:
	Deleted `miter' from parameter list and program as it is not
	necessary, was there for debugging reasons but annoys now.

Wed Nov 12 08:52:22 1997  Berwin Turlach  <berwin.turlach@anu.edu.au>

	* solve.QP.f, solve.QP.compact.f:
	Fixed a bug, if an equality constraint is dropped and the sign of the
	normal vector changes, bvec() wasn't changed.

Tue Jul  1 07:41:19 1997  Berwin Turlach  <berwin.turlach@anu.edu.au>

	* solve.QP.compact.sf, solve.QP.sf:
	Changed error message from "is singular" to "is not positive definite"

	* solve.QP.compact.f, solve.QP.f, solve.QP.sf, First.lib.template, solve.QP.compact.sf:
	Corrected address of Free Software Foundation

	* Release 1.1 ready.
